# Additional Notes
This repository includes my Obsidian files, which document my learning journey with the book Getting Started with Angular by Victor Garcia. These notes try to cover essential topics such as required installations, addons, tutorial challenges, and resolutions. Iâ€™ve structured the notes by chapters and parts for easy navigation.

As this repository is intended for learning purposes, the Obsidian notes are an integral part of understanding the project's purpose. They offer additional context and insights that describe the learning experience to the repository viewer.
